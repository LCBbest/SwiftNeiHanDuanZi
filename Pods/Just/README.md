#   Features

Just lets you to the following effortlessly:

-   URL queries
-   custom headers
-   form (`x-www-form-encoded`) / JSON HTTP body
-   redirect control
-   multipart file upload along with form values.
-   basic/digest authentication
-   cookies
-   timeouts
-   synchronous / asynchronous requests
-   upload / download progress tracking for asynchronous requests
-   link headers
-   friendly accessible results

#  Use

The simplest request with Just looks like this:

```swift
//  A simple get request
Just.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
```

The next example shows how to upload a file along with some data:

```swift
//  talk to registration end point
let r = Just.post(
    "http://justiceleauge.org/member/register",
    data: ["username": "barryallen", "password":"ReverseF1ashSucks"],
    files: ["profile_photo": .URL(fileURLWithPath:"flash.jpeg", nil)]
)

if r.ok { /* success! */ }
```

Here's the same example done asynchronously:

```swift
//  talk to registration end point
Just.post(
    "http://justiceleauge.org/member/register",
    data: ["username": "barryallen", "password":"ReverseF1ashSucks"],
    files: ["profile_photo": .URL(fileURLWithPath:"flash.jpeg", nil)]
) { r in
    if r.ok { /* success! */ }
}

```

#  Install

Here are some ways to leverage Just.

## Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `dependencies`:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/JustHTTP/Just.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 5)
```

## Carthage (Swift 3 only)

Include the following in your Cartfile:

    github "JustHTTP/Just"

Just includes dynamic framework targets for both iOS and OS X.

## CocoaPods

The usual way:

    platform :ios, '8.0'
    use_frameworks!

    target 'MyApp' do
      pod 'Just'
    end

If you use Swift 2.3:

    platform :ios, '8.0'
    use_frameworks!

    target 'MyApp' do
      pod 'Just', :git => 'https://github.com/JustHTTP/Just.git', :branch => 'swift-2.3'
    end

## Manual

Drop `Just.xcodeproj` into your project navigator. Under the *General* tab of
your project settings, use the plus sign to add `Just.framework` to
*Linked Framework and Libraries*. Make sure to include the correct version
for your target's platform.

It's also common to add Just as a git submodule to your projects repository:

    cd path/to/your/project
    git submodule add https://github.org/JustHTTP/Just.git


## Source File

Put `Just.swift` directly into your project. Alternately, put it in the
*Sources* folder of a playground. (The latter makes a fun way to explore the
web.)

#  Contribute

Pull requests are welcome. Here are some tips for code contributors:

Work in `Just.xcworkspace`.

The tests for link headers relies on Github APIs, which has a low per-hour
limit. To overcome this, you can edit the Xcode build schemes and add
[environment variables][XcodeEnvVar]  `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Learn more about
personal tokens [here][GithubToken].

For Xcode rebels, checkout `Makefile` (you'll need [xcpretty][]).
